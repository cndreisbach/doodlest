# Scribblest

A simple Electron app for drawing on an infinite canvas. Useful for teaching. Scribblest is inspired from watching the drawings in Khan Academy videos. The application used in the Khan Academy videos is Windows-only, so I've implemented an Electron program (cross-platform, although I've focused on Mac OS for now) that gives me similar capabilities, but fits my needs better.
